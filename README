wingui - desktop user interface with PHP - Only for embed/CLI SAPI

There is a lot to do here, common controls, windowing, DND and some DDE stuff

Works with PHP 5.3.0+
Works on Windows XP and higher

NOTICE: requires a small patch to windows source when building -
in php-src/main/config.w32.h comment out the following block of code - this does NOT
support windows 2000, we want windows XP and higher

#undef _WIN32_WINNT
#undef NTDDI_VERSION
#define _WIN32_WINNT 0x500
#define NTDDI_VERSION  _WIN32_WIN2K
