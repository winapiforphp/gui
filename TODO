This needs lots of work

1. Finishing Windowing's notifications
2. windowing's messages with UI calls for them
3. finish all functions
4. finish tests for windows
5. move on to resources and common controls

Explicit todos:
Inputing interface
1. tests for register and unregister hotkey (requires key modifiers and virtual keys - class constants or enums - capturing WM_HOTKEY and sending input)
2. tests for dragdetect and capture mouse - not sure how to test those properly yet
